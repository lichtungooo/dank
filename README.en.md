# 🙏 DANK

### Expression of Decentralized Value Creation

---

## 💫 Core Idea

**DANK** is about **decentralized value creation** –
about empowering every person to create value from their own actions, abilities, and contributions to the community.

**DANK** is a **note of exchange** – an expression of a self-created value,
backed by **work, trust, and human connection**.

The value of a DANK arises from what someone does, shares, or contributes.
Its backing comes from **offers and lived trust**.

This creates a network of people, offers, and needs
based on **mutual appreciation and transparency** –
a living cycle in which value flows naturally,
without speculation, interest, or control.

---

## 🪙 Digital and Offline DANK

DANK exists in two forms:

* **Digital DANK** –
  the digital form of the exchange note, transferable via app, QR code, or peer-to-peer connection.
  Here arise wallets, profiles, offers & needs, and DANK can be shared or redeemed directly.

* **Offline DANK** –
  a printed note (for example, as a QR voucher)
  containing the same value commitment, which can later be reconnected digitally.
  This keeps DANK functional even without the internet.

The **Digital DANK** is the **technical realization** of this idea:
it makes value, trust, and community visible, transferable, and tangible –
both digitally and in real life.

---

## 🤝 Community & Trust

DANK emerges from human interaction – not from capital or speculation.
It is built on a **Web of Trust**:
a trust network in which people confirm each other’s ability
to create, exchange, or accept DANK.

### Connection and Community

**DANK** is rooted in real encounters.
It arises where people meet, know, and trust each other.
Trust cannot be created digitally alone –
it grows through conversation, shared work, and mutual support.

This gives rise to **communities** – neighborhoods, groups, and places –
where people begin to **trade with one another**
and express appreciation through DANK.
From these interactions grow **pools of trust**,
autonomous yet interconnected.

These layers of connection – from person to person, place to place –
form a **federated network of trust** built on real encounters.
The digital DANK supports this exchange,
but never replaces it.

From many small communities grows a regional and organic network
of shared value creation –
carried by trust, transparency, and lived humanity.

---

## 🔑 Core Principles

* **Decentralization** – No central platform, no server, no ownership.
  Each person carries the system within themselves – DANK works from person to person.

* **Backed by Work** – Every DANK is tied to real offers and abilities.
  Value arises through action, not capital.

* **Trust as Foundation** – Trust replaces control.
  Relationships are the real security of the system.

* **Connection & Community** – Value arises where people meet.
  DANK thrives on real collaboration, exchange, and mutual support.

* **Map as Central Interface** – All activities, people, places, and communities
  are visible on one shared map.
  It is the entry point into the network and connects all modules together.

* **Modularity & Clarity** – Each module (Profile, Quest, Marketplace, Wallet, Feed)
  stands on its own but is interconnected through profile components.
  This keeps the system organized, flexible, and human.

* **Digital Signatures** – Security through modern cryptography (Ed25519).
  Every action, exchange, and connection is verifiable and authentic.

* **Transparency without Surveillance** – Everything can be traced,
  without central data collection or misuse.

* **Offline Capability & Resilience** – DANK works even without the internet.
  Through QR exchanges, local devices, and real meeting points (e.g., community boards),
  value, offers, and encounters remain active – even during network outages.

* **Flow & Renewal** – DANK is alive.
  Values can expire, allowing renewal and movement to remain part of the system.

## 🧩 Technical Foundation (Digital DANK)

The **Digital DANK** is a **peer-to-peer application** that operates without central servers.
It uses **asymmetric cryptography** (Public/Private Keys) and **digital signatures** (Ed25519)
for authentication, validation, and protection against forgery.

---

## 🧩 Modules and Structure of the Digital DANK

The **Digital DANK** consists of clear, interconnected modules that together form an organic whole.
Each module fulfills a distinct function, while all together make the flow of value, trust, and connection visible.
At the center stands the human being – with their profile, relationships, activities, and joy of participation.

---

### 🗺️ The Map as the Central Element

The **map** is the **core interface** of DANK.
It is the first point of entry into the app – where everything begins.
On the map, you can see:

* people nearby
* communities and locations
* current **quests** (actions, events, adventures)
* the **marketplace** with offers and needs
* and your own location linked to your profile

From here, all modules are accessible: calendar, profile, quests, marketplace, and feed.
The map connects the real world with its digital representation –
it shows where trust, help, appreciation, and activity emerge.
Everything that happens in DANK is located there – **regional, real, and alive**.

---

### 1. Profile

The **profile** is the heart of each participant in DANK.
It gathers personal information, offers, and needs in one place.
It shows who you trust, who you’re connected with,
and what activities, skills, and experiences are part of your value creation.

Core components include:

* **Wallet:** displays available DANK values and transactions.
* **Feed:** records activities, quests, encounters, and shared content.
* **Logbook (Questlog):** chronological overview of all contributions, actions, and participations.
* **Skill Tree:** visualizes development and collected abilities.
* **Trust Network:** overview of people you know or who trust you.
* **Privacy Controls:** decide what is visible or private.

The profile is a living mirror of one’s actions within DANK –
social, economic, and playful at the same time.

---

### 2. Web of Trust

The **Web of Trust** connects people and communities.
Every relationship is built on mutual trust, cryptographically verified.
This network forms both the **social** and **security** backbone of DANK –
enabling self-organization without central authority.

---

### 3. Offers & Needs

Each DANK is backed by **real offers and requests**.
Every person can state what they offer or what they seek.
These define the foundation of value creation – DANK arises from real contribution, not capital.
Hashtags (#garden, #craft, #help) or map searches make it easy to find people and services nearby.

---

### 4. Marketplace & Map

The **marketplace** is integrated directly into the map.
All regional offers, needs, and shared resources are visible there.
You can connect with people, exchange services, or start projects together.
Each interaction links to profiles, quests, or communities
and can optionally appear in your personal feed.

**Example:**
A community shares a **chainsaw**.
You can see where it is, reserve it, use it –
and later organize a woodcutting quest through the calendar.

---

### 5. Quest & Calendar Module

The **quest module** brings the playful side to DANK.
It’s about becoming active in the **real world**: learning, doing, and creating together.
Each quest has a location and time, managed via the integrated **calendar**.

Participants can register directly on the map,
scan a QR code on site, and have their participation documented in their profile.
This updates their skill tree, enriches their feed,
and strengthens new bonds of trust.

In this way, real-life activity becomes visible –
and value creation turns into a joyful, shared process.

---

### 6. Feed

The **feed** documents everything happening in a person’s DANK life:
quests, encounters, DANK transfers, new connections, and market activity.
It is the visible logbook of action and trust –
not for judgment, but for reflection and appreciation.

The feed also serves as a social layer:
you can see others’ updates (depending on trust level), comment, or express DANK.

---

### 7. Offline DANK & Local Interaction

DANK also works **offline**.
Printed QR exchange notes remain transferable and verifiable.
Anyone can create DANK on their local device,
even without internet access.

There are also **analog community points**:
each town or group can have a **notice board** or **exchange box**,
where offers, requests, or local DANK notes are displayed.
This keeps information and exchange alive,
even without screens – through real connection and collaboration.

This makes DANK **resilient and human** –
digitally strong, but never dependent on technology.
Even if the network fails, the principle continues –
on paper, on walls, through encounters.

---

## 🔔 Notifications & Communication

Notifications connect all people and modules in DANK.
They are not meant for distraction, but for **orientation** –
to make sure cooperation and encounters happen at the right time.

**Principles:**

* **Informative, not overwhelming:** reminders for quests, events, and important updates.
* **Connecting:** facilitates communication between people, groups, and communities.
* **Sharing:** allows content to be shared via networks like Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp – always under user control and data minimal.
* **Offline-ready:** messages and QR-based info can also be distributed locally or via physical notice boards.

In DANK, notifications are a **call to connection** –
not a push to the screen, but an **invitation to life**.
Technology simply helps people find one another, come together, and create value.

---

## 🧱 Summary

* The **map** is the central entry point and connects all modules.
* The **profile** is the personal center and reflects one’s contribution.
* The **marketplace**, **quest module**, and **feed** make activity visible.
* The **trust network** creates social security.
* **Notifications** keep the flow going – functional, respectful, human.
* And with **offline capability**, DANK remains alive even without a network.

The Digital DANK is a tool that bridges digital and real worlds –
making decentralized value creation through trust, encounter, and awareness possible in a playful, human way.
